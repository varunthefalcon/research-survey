You are being invited to take part in a research study looking at studentsâ€™ evaluation of the feedback they receive on their written assignments.

<strong>You were chosen as a participant because you are a Year 1 student in the BSc Psychology undergraduate programme at QUB.
Before you decide to take part in this study it is important for you to understand what the research will involve. Please take time to read the following information and do not hesitate to contact us should you require any further details.</strong>

In this survey, we will show you the feedback you received on one of your written assignments, namely your Semester 2 essay on individual differences. We will also show you an alternative version of that feedback.

Once you have read both versions of the feedback, we will ask you to rate their quality using four statements each.
The study should take <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold">no more than 20 minutes</span> to complete. So please take the time and read both versions of the feedback thoroughly before rating their quality. <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold">You will receive an Amazon voucher worth Â£15 for your time. Please continue until the very end of this questionnaire to receive your compensation.</span>

Your participation is entirely voluntary, and you have the right to withdraw at any time during the study by closing this webpage. If you decide to close this webpage before the end of the questionnaire, your partial response will be deleted as a matter of course. Once you have completed the study, you will not be able to withdraw your data.
Please note: Your participation in our study will be treated with confidentiality. The data we gather from you and other participants during this study will be fully anonymised prior to analysis so that no one will be able to link the data to you personally. In addition, we will not share your evaluations with your tutors who provided the feedback. Therefore, you can be completely honest in your evaluations.
Since the data we collect from you may be of interest to other researchers, we will publish it on a publicly accessible online data repository. At that point, anyone will have access to your anonymised (i.e., non-identifiable) data.

Our research depends crucially on the generous help of participants like yourself. We hope that you can assist us with this project.

If you have any further queries, please do not hesitate to contact Dr Thomas Schultze at <span style="color:red">t.schultze@qub.ac.uk</span>
